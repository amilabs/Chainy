# Chainy — blockchain engravings 


### AEON links + Proof of Existence + Files + Messages 

Chainy is the most independent Ethereum based smart contract, which exists for as long as blockchain lives. It's independent from anybody. Even if we abandon this project, and it will be impossible to look up the data using other viewers or blockchain explorers or scanners, all previously stored proofs and data will be available via the Ethereum API, for example through Mist or open source viewer.
